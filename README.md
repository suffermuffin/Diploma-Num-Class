My graduation project where I first started to learn machine learning
and neural networks. Nothing fancy, just a basic NN trained on a MNIST dataset.
Main sources are [Michael Nielsen's](https://michaelnielsen.org/) book "[Neural Networks and Deep Learning]()"
and [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown) series "[Neural networks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi)".

Work consists of a model training algorythm "[Number_Class.ipynb](Number_Class.ipynb)", data preparation algorythm "[Img_Prep.ipynb](Img_Prep.ipynb)" 
and algorythm that let's you use trained model on a custom dataset "[Upload_Test.ipynb](Upload_Test.ipynb)".
